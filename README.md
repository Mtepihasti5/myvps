# MyVPS — Scripts by Mtepihasti5

MyVPS is a collection of Bash scripts used to set up and manage lightweight VPS-style environments (GoormIDE, GitHub Codespaces) and general Linux VPS/PC systems. The scripts automate tasks like installing a desktop + VNC, basic system tweaks, IP detection, and simple security tools.

## What’s included
- VNC + desktop environment setup (GNOME or Xfce) with LightDM
- Public IP detection using icanhazip.com
- System tweaks and automation scripts
- Basic security and access utilities

## Quick start
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Mtepihasti5/myvps.git
2. Enter the directory:
   cd myvps
3. List available scripts:
   ls -1
4. Run a setup script

## Recommended environment
- Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions (most tested)
- GitHub Codespaces or GoormIDE for quick demos
- sudo/root access is required for installation scripts

## Security notes
- Always review scripts before running (cat, less, or open in an editor).
- Scripts require elevated privileges — run only on systems you control or trust.
